# The Agentic Health Manifesto

We didn’t build this for a startup pitch. We built this in the quiet hours of the night and over stolen weekends, because someone we love was running out of time. We built this because the speed of the medical system does not match the urgency of personal necessity.

For years, we have accepted a massive asymmetry in healthcare. The system holds the data, the time, and the expertise. When a rare disease strikes, or when standard treatments fail, patients and their families are told to wait.

We are done waiting.

We are entering a new era. Agentic Engineering changed how we build software. Agentic Workflows changed how we automate business. **Agentic Health** will change how we take care of ourselves.

> **Agentic Health** is the deployment of autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of the individual to bridge the gap between global medical research and personal health data. It is the shift from passively receiving care to actively orchestrating it.

### 1. From Quantified Self to Agentic Action

For the past decade, the *Quantified Self* movement gave us the tools to track our bodies. We collected billions of data points on sleep, heart rate, and blood work. But data without interpretation is just noise. It gave us dashboards; it gave us data fatigue.

Quantified Self was the black box recording the flight. Agentic Health is the tireless analyst deciphering the recording in real-time. We are no longer just collecting data; we are deploying agents to read it, contextualize it, and act on it.

### 2. "Normal" is Not "Optimal"

The medical system operates on statistical averages. If your lab results fall within a broad historical range, you are told you are "fine." But normal according to a local lab and optimal according to the latest global research are two different things.

Doctors do not have the time to read the 30 million papers on PubMed to see if your specific combination of markers indicates a hidden risk or a new therapeutic pathway. Our agents do. They don't sleep, they don't get fatigued, and they don't accept "good enough."

### 3. The Tireless Advocate

Agentic Health is not a replacement for your doctor. It is the extra pair of eyes that never gets tired. It is a dedicated research team working 24/7 to:

- Translate your medical records into actionable insights.
- Cross-reference your blood work against the latest pre-prints and clinical trials.
- Map out alternative treatments, funding for rare diseases, and clinical trials your physician hasn't heard of yet.
- Equip you with the exact questions you need to ask at your next consultation.

### 4. Data Sovereignty

Your health data belongs to you. Agentic Health relies on open-source tools that run locally, pulling your data securely and keeping it in your hands. We are breaking down the walled gardens of medical data, allowing your personal AI to work for *you*, not for the system.

### The Way Forward

We are crowdsourcing a cure for the blind spots in modern medicine. Whether it is finding a loophole for a terminal parent, or mapping clinical trials for a rare genetic disease, the tools are now in our hands.

The system won't save us fast enough. So we will build the agents that will.

## The Ecosystem

Agentic Health is not a single tool—it is an ecosystem of open-source projects, APIs, prompts, and knowledge shared across the community.

Explore the framework:

- **[The Directory](./directory/README.md)**: A curated list of existing open-source health agent projects.
- **[Skills & Connectors](./skills/README.md)**: Drop-in tools and APIs to connect agents to health data (PubMed, Apple Health, Sundhed.dk).
- **[Prompts](./prompts/README.md)**: High-quality, tested system instructions for rigorous medical AI.
- **[Case Studies](./case-studies/README.md)**: Real-world examples and proofs of work.
