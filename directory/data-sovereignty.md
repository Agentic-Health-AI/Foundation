# Data Sovereignty & Privacy

Tools for patient-controlled health data, federated learning, and privacy-preserving AI.

- **[Fasten Health](https://github.com/fastenhealth/fasten-onprem)**: Self-hosted personal health record aggregator that enables patients to consolidate and control their medical data across multiple providers without cloud dependencies.

- **[Vantage6](https://github.com/vantage6/vantage6)**: Federated learning platform enabling collaborative health research where algorithms travel to data instead of centralizing sensitive patient information.

- **[NVIDIA FLARE](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVFlare)**: Production-grade federated learning framework with built-in healthcare support for privacy-preserving AI model training across distributed datasets.

- **[Mere Medical](https://github.com/cfu288/mere-medical)**: Offline-first self-hosted health records system designed for patients to maintain complete ownership of their medical information locally.

- **[OpenMined/PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)**: Privacy-preserving machine learning framework enabling AI model training on sensitive health data without requiring direct data access or centralization.

- **[Solid Project](https://github.com/solid)**: Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized web architecture using personal data pods, enabling patients to control access to their health information with granular permissions.

- **[Consent2Share](https://github.com/bhits/consent2share)**: Patient-controlled consent management system giving individuals centralized governance over how their health data is shared and used by healthcare providers.
