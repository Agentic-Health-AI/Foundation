# Medical LLMs & Foundation Models

Open-source language models trained or fine-tuned for biomedical and clinical applications.

- **[OpenMed](https://huggingface.co/blog/MaziyarPanahi/openmed-year-in-review-2025)**: A comprehensive collection of 380+ medical models under Apache 2.0 license, providing a centralized resource for open medical AI research and deployment.

- **[OpenBioLLM](https://huggingface.co/blog/aaditya/openbiollm)**: Outperforms GPT-4 on biomedical benchmarks, offering a powerful open alternative for specialized biomedical question-answering and research tasks.

- **[Meditron](https://github.com/epfLLM/meditron)**: A prominent open medical LLM built on Llama-2, designed specifically for medical knowledge and clinical applications.

- **[BioMistral](https://github.com/BioMistral/BioMistral)**: A lightweight yet performant biomedical model based on Mistral-7B, optimized for efficiency without sacrificing medical expertise.

- **[Hippocrates](https://cyberiada.github.io/Hippocrates/)**: 7B parameter models that surpass the performance of much larger 70B models, demonstrating efficient medical knowledge representation.

- **[PMC-LLaMA](https://github.com/chaoyi-wu/PMC-LLaMA)**: Incorporates extensive PubMed domain knowledge to provide specialized biomedical literature understanding and medical information retrieval.

- **[GatorTron](https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/GatorTron)**: The largest clinical language model, trained on extensive clinical text to capture nuanced medical language and clinical decision support.

- **[LLaVA-Med](https://github.com/microsoft/LLaVA-Med)**: A multimodal biomedical vision-language model that combines image and text understanding for comprehensive medical analysis.

- **[DoctorGPT](https://github.com/tmc/DoctorGPT)**: A lightweight local-first medical AI that requires only 3GB storage and runs cross-platform, making medical LLM technology accessible without cloud infrastructure.

- **[BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert)**: A foundational biomedical NLP model that has become essential infrastructure for biomedical text mining and named entity recognition tasks.
