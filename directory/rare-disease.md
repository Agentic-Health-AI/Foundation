# Rare Disease

Tools for rare disease diagnosis, patient matching, registries, and advocacy.

- **[SHEPHERD](https://github.com/mims-harvard/SHEPHERD)**: Phenotype-driven computational tool for rare disease diagnosis that prioritizes genetic variants based on patient clinical phenotypes.

- **[Exomiser](https://github.com/exomiser/Exomiser)**: Gold standard tool for rare disease variant prioritization that combines variant pathogenicity predictions with patient phenotype matching.

- **[Monarch Initiative](https://github.com/monarch-initiative)**: Open knowledge graph integrating genes, diseases, and phenotypes to enable comprehensive rare disease discovery and understanding.

- **[LIRICAL](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/LIRICAL)**: Likelihood-ratio based clinical interpretation tool that analyzes patient phenotypes to identify causative genetic variants in rare diseases.

- **[PatientMatcher](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/patientMatcher)**: Matchmaker Exchange implementation enabling patient matching across institutions to find similar rare disease cases for collaborative diagnosis and research.

- **[RDRF](https://github.com/muccg/rdrf)**: Open-source rare disease registry framework designed to support the collection, management, and analysis of patient data for rare disease research and outcomes tracking.

- **[MToolBox](https://github.com/mitoNGS/MToolBox)**: Comprehensive toolkit for mitochondrial DNA analysis and interpretation, particularly relevant for rare mitochondrial diseases including LHON.

- **[RareCamp/OpenTreatments](https://rarecamp.org/)**: Patient-led platform by the Linux Foundation for collaborative gene therapy development and rare disease treatment advancement.
