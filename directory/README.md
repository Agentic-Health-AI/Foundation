## Research Agents

- **[LHONOpenClaw](#)**: A decentralized swarm of OpenClaw AI agents dedicated to finding funding, mapping clinical trials, and surfacing adjacent therapies for Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON). Created by Thomas Saaby Noer.

## Data Connectors & Analyzers

- **[Sundhed.dk Lab Reviewer](#)**: A local-first workflow integrating with Claude Code that uses Playwright to securely log into Sundhed.dk via MitID, downloads the user's laboratory results, and cross-references them against recent studies in PubMed and medRxiv to flag optimal vs. normal ranges.
