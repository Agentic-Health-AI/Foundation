# MCP Servers for Health

Model Context Protocol servers that give AI agents access to health data and clinical tools.

- **[PubMed MCP Server](https://github.com/cyanheads/pubmed-mcp-server)**: Search and retrieve biomedical literature directly from PubMed through an MCP interface, enabling AI agents to access peer-reviewed research.

- **[Medical MCP Server](https://github.com/JamesANZ/medical-mcp)**: Comprehensive medical data access including FDA records, WHO guidelines, PubMed articles, Google Scholar results, and RxNorm drug information in a single MCP server.

- **[Healthcare MCP Server](https://github.com/Cicatriiz/healthcare-mcp-public)**: Integrated healthcare data access with FDA, PubMed, medRxiv preprints, ICD-10 codes, and DICOM imaging support for clinical research and decision support.

- **[FHIR MCP Server](https://github.com/the-momentum/fhir-mcp-server)**: Query and interact with FHIR-compliant health data using natural language, bridging the gap between clinical data standards and AI agents.

- **[Apple Health MCP Server](https://github.com/the-momentum/apple-health-mcp-server)**: Access personal health data from Apple Health using DuckDB queries, enabling integration with wearable and health tracking data.

- **[Open Wearables MCP](https://github.com/the-momentum/open-wearables)**: Unified interface for wearable device data, providing standardized access to health metrics from multiple wearable sources.

- **[OMOP MCP Server](https://github.com/fastomop/omcp)**: Query observational medical outcomes partnership (OMOP) common data models using natural language for analysis of clinical datasets.

- **[OMOP Terminology MCP](https://github.com/OHNLP/omop_mcp)**: Map clinical terminology to OMOP standards, enabling consistent representation of medical concepts across different data sources.

- **[OpenMedicine MCP](https://github.com/RamosFBC/openmedicine)**: Evidence-based clinical reasoning and decision support through structured access to medical knowledge and best practices.

- **[ClinicalTrials.gov MCP Server](https://github.com/cyanheads/clinicaltrialsgov-mcp-server)**: Search and retrieve clinical trial information from ClinicalTrials.gov, helping identify relevant research studies and treatment options.
