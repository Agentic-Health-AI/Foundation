# Genomics & Variant Databases

APIs and databases for genomic variants, gene annotations, and protein data.

- **[ClinVar](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)**: NCBI archive of variant-phenotype relationships with clinical significance assertions. Includes Entrez API for programmatic access to millions of curated variant records.

- **[gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)**: Large-scale population variant frequency database covering hundreds of thousands of genomes and exomes. Provides GraphQL API for querying allele frequencies across diverse populations.

- **[Ensembl REST API](https://rest.ensembl.org/)**: Comprehensive genome annotation resource with 100+ REST endpoints for accessing gene models, variants, regulatory regions, and comparative genomics data without authentication required.

- **[PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/)**: Open database of validated polygenic risk scores with detailed documentation and scoring file downloads for predicting complex disease susceptibility.

- **[UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/)**: Comprehensive protein sequence and functional annotation database with REST API supporting millions of requests monthly. Integrates sequences, domains, interactions, and disease associations.

- **[OMIM](https://www.omim.org/api)**: Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man—catalog of human genes and genetic disorders with a free academic API for accessing disease-gene relationships and inheritance patterns.
