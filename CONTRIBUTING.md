# Contributing to Agentic Health

Welcome! The goal of this repository is to create a powerful, transparent, and collaborative ecosystem of open-source health tools powered by AI agents.

Whether you're an engineer building a new connector, a medical professional sharing insight, or simply someone wanting to share a prompt that worked well for you—your help is needed.

## How to Contribute

This repository acts as the central hub for the Agentic Health movement. You can contribute in the following categories:

### 1. The Directory (`/directory`)
Have you built or found a tool that uses AI agents for personal health? Submit it to the directory.
- Projects should ideally be open-source.
- Provide a brief description and a link to the original repository.

### 2. Skills & Connectors (`/skills`)
Building blocks for agents. These are modular scripts or APIs that allow personal AIs to communicate with the real world (e.g., downloading labs, cross-referencing papers).
- Share the repository link or folder containing the skill.
- Ensure any authentication methods (like OAuth or MitID) are well documented.

### 3. Prompts (`/prompts`)
The hardest part of Agentic Health is preventing hallucinations and ensuring rigorous medical reasoning. Share your battle-tested system prompts.
- Let us know *how* the prompt is intended to be used (e.g., interacting with MedRxiv).
- Mention which LLM backend the prompt was designed for (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4).

### 4. Case Studies (`/case-studies`)
We need real-world proofs of concept. If you used an agent to discover an insight that standard care missed, document it.
- **IMPORTANT**: Remove all personally identifiable information (PII). Anonymize your data.
- Structure your case study with: The Problem, The Agent's Approach/Tools, and The Outcome.

## Guidelines

1. **Do No Harm:** We are building tools that empower individuals, not medical devices. Always include clear disclaimers that these tools do not replace professional medical advice.
2. **Privacy First:** Never commit personal health information (PHI) or personal identifiable information (PII) to this repository.
3. **Openness:** Favor open-source licenses (like MIT or Apache 2.0).
4. **Transparency:** Ensure agents cite their sources rigorously when creating clinical or research-based workflows.

To make an addition, simply fork this repository, add your content to the appropriate folder or Markdown file, and submit a **Pull Request**.
